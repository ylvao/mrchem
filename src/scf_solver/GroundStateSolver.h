/** @class GroundStateSolver
 *
 * @brief Ground state SCF optimization with kinetic energy operator
 *
 * This ground state SCF solver computes the Fock matrix explicitly by application of
 * the kinetic energy operator. This simplifies the algorithm significanly when a KAIN
 * iterative accelerator is present, or when diagonalization/localization occurs.
 * The derivative operator in the kinetic energy MIGHT affect the quadratic precision
 * in the energy, but this point seems to no longer be critical.
 *
 * NOTE: The old algorithm which completely avoided the kinetic energy operator has
 *       been removed, but can be recovered from the git history if needed in the
 *       future (search for EnergyOptimizer).
