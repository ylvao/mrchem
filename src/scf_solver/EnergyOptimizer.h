/** @class EnergyOptimizer
 *
 * @brief Ground state SCF optimization without kinetic energy operator
 *
 * This ground state SCF solver completely avoids the use of the kinetic energy
 * operator in the solution algorithm, in particular by computing a potential
 * update to the Fock matrix at the given iteration. This algorithm is considerably
 * less robust than the regular OrbitalOptimizer since there is no KAIN accelerator,
 * and is meant to be used only in the final iterations of the SCF procedure in order
 * to ensure quadratic precision of the energy relative to the orbitals (the effect
 * of this is currently questionable, after the improved implementation of derivative
 * operators in MRCPP).
