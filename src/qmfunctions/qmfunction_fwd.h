/** Notes on vectors:
 * The OrbitalVector (std::vector<Orbital>) is conceptually different from the
 * QMFunctionVector (std::vector<QMFunction>). The former should be a collection
 * of orbitals defining a proper Slater determinant, while the latter is any
 * arbitrary collection of functions (could also be orbitals) used e.g. when
 * adding several orbitals into one. The difference is important when MPI is
 * considered, as OrbitalVectors are distributed while QMFunctionVectors are
 * not. This is reflected in the functionality that is available for the
 * different vectors, where OrbitalVectors should always be treated as a whole,
 * e.g. in an orbital rotation Psi = orbital::rotate(U, Phi), where U is a
 * unitary matrix. This operation is MPI safe and all necessary communication
 * happen automatically under the hood. This is opposed to the similar linear
 * combination qmfunction::linear_combination(func_out, coefs_vec, func_vec)
 * where no MPI is considered.
