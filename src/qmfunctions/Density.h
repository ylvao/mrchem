/** @class Density
 *
 * @brief General complex-valued function to handle densities (incl trans. densities)
 *
 * Inherits the general features of a complex function from QMFunction which
 * means separate MW function representations for the real and imaginary parts.
 * Note that there are several options for copying/assignment: the proper copy
 * constructor and assignment operator are *shallow* copies, which means that
 * they simply copy the *re and *im pointers (no transfer of ownership).
 * Additionaly, there is a deepCopy() which returns a *full* copy of the density.
 *
 * NOTE: since the standard copies are shallow copies and several densitys can
 * point to the same MW functions, it is YOUR responibility to keep track of the
 * ownership and free the FunctionTree pointers before the last density goes out
 * of scope.
