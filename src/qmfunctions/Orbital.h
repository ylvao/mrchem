/** @class Orbital
 *
 * @brief General complex-valued function with spin
 *
 * Inherits the general features of a complex function from mrcpp::CompFunction<3> which
 * means separate MW function representations for the real and imaginary parts.
 * Note that there are several options for copying/assignment: the proper copy
 * constructor and assignment operator are *shallow* copies, which means that
 * they simply copy the *re and *im pointers (no transfer of ownership).
 * Additionaly, there is a deepCopy() which returns a *full* copy of the orbital,
 * and a paramCopy() which returns an empty orbital with the same rank_id/spin/occ.
 *
 * NOTE: since the standard copies are shallow copies and several orbitals can
 * point to the same MW functions, it is YOUR responibility to keep track of the
 * ownership and free the FunctionTree pointers before the last orbital goes out
 * of scope.
