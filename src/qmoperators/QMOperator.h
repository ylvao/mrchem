/** @class QMOperator
 *
 * @brief Fundamental quantum mechanical operator
 *
 * Base class to handle operators and their application in the QM sense. Used to
 * build more complicated operators through the TensorOperator classes. This class
 * hierarchy should NOT be used directly, as the most important functionality is
 * protected. A proper interface is provided through RankZeroTensorOperator.
 *
 * Notes on naming conventions of derived operator classes:
 * Direct decendants of QMOperator should START with "QM", like QMPotential, QMSpin,
 * QMMomentum. Further decendants of QMPotential should END with "Potential", like
 * PositionPotential, NuclearPotential, CoulombPotential. Decendants of the
 * TensorOperators should end with "Operator" (except the perturbation operators
 * H_E_dip, H_B_dip, etc). E.i. the NuclearOperator IS a TensorOperator that
 * CONTAINS a NuclearPotential which IS a QMPotential which IS a QMOperator.
 * Capiche?
