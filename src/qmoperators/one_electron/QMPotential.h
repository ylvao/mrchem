 *
 * Inherits the general features of a complex function from QMFunction and
 * implements the multiplication of this function with an Orbital. The actual
 * function representing the operator needs to be implemented in the derived
 * classes, where the *re and *im FunctionTree pointers should be assigned in
 * the setup() function and deallocated in the clear() function.
