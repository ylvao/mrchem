 * @brief External electric field operator
 *
 * An external electric field interacts with the molecular dipole
 * moment. The operator is simply implemented as a scalar product of
 * the dipole moment operator with the electric field vector.
 *
 * It implements also explicit trace functions for the nuclear contributions
