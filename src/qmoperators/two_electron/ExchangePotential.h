/** @class ExchangePotential
 *
 *  @brief Hartree-Fock exchange potential defined by a particular set of orbitals
 *
 * The operator is defined as the Hartree-Fock exchange arising from a particular
 * set of orbitals. The OrbitalVector defining the operator is fixed throughout the
 * operators life time, but the orbitals themselves are allowed to change in between
 * each application. The internal exchange potentials (the operator applied to it's
 * own orbitals) can be precomputed and stored for fast retrieval. Option to use
 * screening based on previous calculations of the internal exchange (make sure that
 * the internal orbitals haven't been significantly changed since the last time the
 * operator was set up, e.g. through an orbital rotation).
