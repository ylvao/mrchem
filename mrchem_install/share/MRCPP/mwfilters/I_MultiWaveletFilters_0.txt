Checking the orthogonality conditions on the filters:
(see: Alpert, Beylkin, Gines, Vozovoi).
OBS: These filters should really be computed using extended precision.

The matrix identity: Id = (H0^T)H0+(G0^T)G0, has righthand side equal:

1e+00

The matrix identity: Id = (H1^T)H1+(G1^T)G1, has righthand side equal:

1e+00

The matrix identity: 0 = (H0^T)H1+(G0^T)G1, has righthand side equal:

5e-35
