Data directory that contains the radial potentials and relativistic dampening functions for the azora method.
Format of the potential files: Data is stored columnwise. First column is the dampening function (not read), second column is radius, third is atomic zora potential.
The potentials were generated with a sperically symmetric LDA calculation and a gaussian nuclear potential of width 1e-4.
